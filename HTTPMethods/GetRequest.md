# Get Request 
One of the most common HTTPMethods is a **GET** request, which is often used for a rest api (getting data from an online endpoint). 
REST is commonly used by people on web systems to interact with each other. For example, retrieving and updating account information in a social media application.

<ins>The URLSession class and related classes provide an API for downloading data from and uploading data to endpoints indicated by URLs.</ins>

Using the endpoint for a random joke, a get request is made in the following way...

### Code Overview in Playgrounds 
``` Swift
import UIKit

struct Joke: Decodable {
    let type: String
    let setup: String
    let punchline: String
    let id: Int
}

var dataTask: URLSessionDataTask?
var jokes = [Joke]()

let endpoint = "https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/ten"
let url = URL(string: endpoint)!


dataTask = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
    guard let data = data else {
        return
    }
    do {
        let jokeResults = try JSONDecoder().decode([Joke].self, from: data)
        jokes = jokeResults
        print(jokes)
    } catch {
        print("Error decoding jokes: \(error)")
    }
}
dataTask?.resume()

extension Joke: CustomStringConvertible {
    var description: String {
        return "\(setup)? \(punchline)!"
    }
}

```
### Output

Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!, Lady: How do I spread love in this cruel world?? Random Dude: [...ðŸ’˜]!, What did the router say to the doctor?? It hurts when IP.!]


### Another way to easily make a GET request in playgrounds is...
``` Swift

var iTunesSearchAPI = "https://itunes.apple.com/search"

var urlComponents2 = URLComponents(string: iTunesSearchAPI)!
urlComponents2.queryItems = [
    "term": "batman",
    "media": "movie",
    "limit": "5"
].map { URLQueryItem(name: $0.key
                     ,value: $0.value)}

Task {
    let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: urlComponents2.url!)
    if let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpResponse.statusCode == 200, let string = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
        print(string)
    }
}
```
